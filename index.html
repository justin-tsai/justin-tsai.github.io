                    <p>I'm Justin, and I'm a graduate of Cal Poly Pomona with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. Hard worker and passionate learner seeking new challenges. Able to apply what I've learned to transform ideas into reality from start to finish. 

I have four years of Java experience and two years of Unity and C# experience. As a student, I mainly coded in Java, thriving in team environments while utilizing concepts such as OO principles and AGILE/SCRUM processes for group projects. As a Junior, I joined the Cal Poly Pomona Virtual Reality Lab as a member to research ways VR can be incorporated into research and education. This is where I developed and honed my Unity and C# skills to create Unity and VR/AR projects.

I'm excited to tackle on new projects and currently looking for a company to grow together with. Below are links to projects Iâ€™m proud of.

                        <p>
                            Spellbreaker VR is a game made in Unity. Set in a cosmic space-like environment, the player uses swords to slash through a flurry of magic projectiles aimed at them. This is my take on Beat Saber, but with a small twist of being in a different environment and added mechanics. I was responsible for game design, mechanics, audio, particle systems, and player controls.

                        <p>
                           	 VR Combination and Permutation is a research project that aims to test the player's understanding of combination and permutation by having them solve puzzles using each concept to escape a trapped room. Each puzzle has statistics to display the number of possible guesses to the solution. The project was presented to Cal Poly Pomona's 13th Annual Science Research Symposium. I was responsible for environment interactions, audio, and player controls.

                           	 VR Wildfire is a research project that simulates a scenario in which the user is caught in the middle of a wildfire to see what courses of action the user takes. This was an existing project that I took over to fix errors that would arise during the playthrough. For example, in the video gameplay linked there was an audio issue during the presentation would loop endlessly, which is now fixed.

                           	Below Haven is a project I developed in a team of 5 that made for my game development class. The idea for the game was heavily inspired by the series Made In Abyss. This is a 2D game in which the player has to travel underground to discover treasure and riches, but the levels and enemies get harder as they venture further below. I found assets and implemented the scripts for movement, enemy interactions, and audio.

                           	Isolation is a game that can be played by running the program on the console. The goal of the game is to trap the other player by using previous moves to block them off. The player plays against an computer that makes its moves using a min-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening.
